Demon Turf Save Manager


A simple Save Manager for the 2021 videogame Demon Turf developed by the indie studio Fabraz Inc. and published by Playtonic Friends. This Save Manager is technically also compatible with their Demo and Trials releases, though neither of those really support saving the game.

This program creates a folder called `_dtsm` in Demon Turf's save directory, moves all existing save files (any `*.txt` files, to be exact) to that folder and swaps out the actual `DTSaveData.txt` with whichever file is markes as 'Active' as indicated with a checked checkbox.
Currently supports Steam and GOG. (Thanks VTVRVXIV!)

IMPORTANT! Please back up your important files BEFORE using this program. While I don't think I made any critical mistakes, it's better to be safe than sorry!
